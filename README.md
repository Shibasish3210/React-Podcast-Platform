# PodZone
PodZone is a platform where users can create, share and listen to podcasts. PodZone allows users to express their thoughts, opinions, stories, and passions through audio content. PodZone also enables users to discover and enjoy podcasts from other creators on various topics and genres.

## Installation
To install PodZone, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js
- npm
- Firebase

You can download or clone the project from this GitHub repository:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/podzone.git`

Then, you need to install the dependencies using npm:

`npm install`

Next, you need to create a Firebase project and configure the authentication, storage, and database services. You can follow the instructions from the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs).

Finally, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your Firebase configuration keys as environment variables. For example:

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key
REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
REACT_APP_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

## Usage
To run PodZone locally, you can use the following command:

`npm start`

This will start a development server on http://localhost:3000.

To use PodZone, you need to sign up or log in with your email and password. After logging in, you will be redirected to your profile page, where you can change your name, profile picture, primary email, or delete your account.

You can also create your own podcast by clicking on the "Create Podcast" button on the navigation bar. You need to provide a display image, a banner image, a title, and a description for your podcast. After creating your podcast, you will be redirected to your podcast page, where you can add new episodes by uploading audio files with titles and descriptions.

You can also listen to podcasts from other creators by clicking on the "Podcasts" button on the navigation bar. You can browse podcasts by categories or search for podcasts by keywords. You can play podcasts using the audio player component at the bottom of the page.
